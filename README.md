# Physics Simulation

## üìå Overview

A C++ physics simulation project using modern OpenGL (GLFW) for real-time visualization of particles and fields. The system is modular, supporting extensible simulation laws (Newton's Laws), and is designed for future integration with ImGui for interactive UI controls.

## üõ†Ô∏è Selected Technologies

### 1. C++ 17

The main programming language, chosen for its performance and modern features, enabling efficient simulation and extensible architecture.

### 2. OpenGL (GLFW)

Used for rendering the simulation in real time, handling window/context creation, and drawing particles and fields.

On Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential cmake libglfw3-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
```

### 3. Build the Project

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### 4. Run the Simulation

```bash
./physics-simulation
```
